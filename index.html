          As a Back-end Developer for our in-house project, I implemented
          FIN-TECH integrations with various payment solution providers. I
          developed a standard application (ongoing) using the gRPC protocol,
          buffers, socket connections, and integrated a proxy for seamless
          communication between different applications. I utilized MongoDB and
          LiteDb as the database management systems and incorporated caching
          solutions for performance optimization. Additionally, I implemented
          the Observable design pattern for event-driven processing and utilized
          a locking system to ensure data integrity in concurrent scenarios

        It was my first experience of working in Development field. At first I
        started as a junior Front-end developer, working on existing project
        about touristic app using Angular stack. My coworkers taught me
        everything I needed to start my journey in this field. Then I got
        interested in back-end development and started learning C# language and
        .Net and got first experience in back-end development too.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <h4>Jobboard</h4>
      <p>
        AS A BACK-END DEVELOPER FOR THE “JOBBOARD” PROJECT I HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED
        ON IMPLEMENTING .NET SOFTWARE, BASING IT ON S.O.L.I.D. PRINCIPLES, AND
        INCLUDED VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS: EF-CORE, MAPSTER, REDIS DB, MSSQL DB
        AND OTHERS. MY MAIN FOCUS WAS TO MAKE A ROBUST, RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT
        SOFTWARE AS THE REQUESTS WERE MAINLY WORKING ON THE CANDIDATE DATA THAT
        SHOULD BE PROJECTED ON A MAP AND EACH REQUEST BY THE CLIENT SHOULD BE
        HANDLED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. IN DOING SO I HAVE GONE THROUGH MANY STEPS
        OF ARCHITECTURAL REVISION TO MAKE A SCALABLE SOFTWARE AND HAVE ACHIEVED
        A DELTA OF SUB 10MS FOR THE REQUESTS OF 100+ CANDIDATES ON A 10K+ USER
        LOAD.

        ARCHITECTURE THAT HAS A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH, MEANING DATABASE, FOR
        THE MULTI-USER SYSTEM. KEEPING SEGREGATION FOR THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES
        AND/OR DEPARTMENTS, WHICH ARE, IN SHORT, DIFFERENT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.
        MOST VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THE PROJECT WAS ENVISIONING THE

        ALSO, THE PROJECT HAD CHALLENGES THAT INCLUDED INTEGRATIONS, MIGRATIONS
        AND PROVISIONING THAT WERE RESOLVED IN A SHORT TIME
